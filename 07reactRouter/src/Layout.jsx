/*

{ Outlet } from 'react-router-dom': This imports the Outlet component from the 'react-router-dom' library. The Outlet component is used in React Router to render child routes.
Functional Component - Layout:

The Layout function is a functional component that returns JSX to define the layout of the application.
It consists of a fragment (<>...</>) wrapping the entire layout, allowing multiple elements to be returned without a parent container.
Inside the fragment, it includes:
<Header />: This renders the Header component imported earlier. This is likely a component responsible for rendering the header section of the layout.
<Outlet />: This renders the child routes defined in the routing configuration. In a React Router setup, child routes are rendered within the parent route using the Outlet component.
<Footer />: This renders the Footer component imported earlier. This is likely a component responsible for rendering the footer section of the layout.
Usage:

This Layout component serves as a higher-order component (HOC) that provides a consistent layout structure for multiple pages/routes in the application.
By wrapping pages or routes with the Layout component, you ensure that each page includes the common header and footer components without needing to repeat them in every individual page/component.
Concept - Layout Component:

The concept of a layout component is to create a reusable structure for the UI of your application. It separates the concerns of header, footer, and main content rendering, making it easier to maintain and modify.
By encapsulating the common layout elements in a single component (Layout), you achieve consistency across multiple pages/routes of your application.
Internal Working:

When a page or route is rendered with the Layout component, the Header and Footer components are included at the top and bottom of the layout, respectively.
The Outlet component renders the child routes defined in the routing configuration. This allows each specific page or route to render its content within the layout structure provided by the Layout component.
In summary, the Layout component defines the overall structure of the application layout, including common elements such as header and footer, while allowing individual pages/routes to render their content within this consistent layout structure. This promotes code reusability and maintainability in React applications.
