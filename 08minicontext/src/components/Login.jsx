Initializes state variables username and password using the useState hook.
These variables hold the values entered by the user in the username and password fields.
    */

Uses the useContext hook to access the UserContext.
Destructures the setUser function from the context, which presumably allows updating user-related data in the application.
    */

Defines a handleSubmit function triggered when the form is submitted.
Prevents the default form submission behavior using e.preventDefault().
Calls the setUser function from the context, passing an object containing the username and password entered by the user.

Renders a form with input fields for username and password.
Binds the input values to state variables username and password and updates them on change.
Provides a submit button that triggers the handleSubmit function when clicked.

/*
Reasoning:
State Management:

Reasoning: Using useState to manage username and password states allows capturing user input in real-time.
Effect on Application: Ensures that the values entered by the user are tracked and updated as they type, facilitating form interaction.
User Context Usage:

Reasoning: Accessing the UserContext via useContext provides access to user-related functions (such as setUser) throughout the component hierarchy.
Effect on Application: Enables updating user-related data stored in the context, such as authentication status or user profile information, based on the user input provided in the login form.
Form Submission Handling:

Reasoning: Handling form submission using handleSubmit allows for custom logic, such as validating user input or making API requests.
Effect on Application: Provides a mechanism to process user input and trigger appropriate actions, such as updating user data or navigating to a different page, upon form submission.
