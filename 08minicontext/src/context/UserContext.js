This code snippet defines a React context named UserContext using the createContext function from React

// context gives provider
/*
Uses the createContext function from React to create a new context named UserContext.
This context serves as a container for user-related data and functions that can be accessed by components within its consumer hierarchy.
*/

export default UserContext;

/*
Exports the UserContext object to make it available for other components to use.
This allows other components to consume the user context and access its data and functions using the useContext hook.
*/

/*
Reasoning:
Context Creation:

Reasoning: Creating a context (UserContext) provides a way to share user-related data and functions across multiple components in the application without having to pass props manually at each level.
Effect on Application: Encapsulates user-related logic and state management in a centralized location, promoting code reusability and maintainability throughout the application.
Exporting Context:

Reasoning: Exporting the UserContext object allows other components to consume it and access its data and functions.
Effect on Application: Enables components that need access to user-related data or functions to import and use the UserContext, facilitating communication between different parts of the application without introducing tight coupling.
