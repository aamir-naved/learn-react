user stores the user-related data (or null if no user is logged in).
setUser is a function used to update the user state.

Wraps the children components with the UserContext.Provider.

/*
Reasoning:
Context Provider:

Reasoning: Creating a provider component (UserContextProvider) allows other components to access user-related data and functions stored in the UserContext.
Effect on Application: Facilitates the sharing of user-related state and logic across the application, ensuring consistency and providing a centralized location for managing user data.
State Management:

Reasoning: Managing the user state within the provider component enables updating the user data and propagating changes to all components that consume the UserContext.
Effect on Application: Enables components to access and modify the user state in a predictable and controlled manner, ensuring that the application responds appropriately to user actions and authentication status changes.
