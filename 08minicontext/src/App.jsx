This code snippet represents the main component of the application (App) where the Login and Profile components are rendered within the UserContextProvider. Let's break down its structure and functionality:
*/

<h1>React with Context API</h1>
  <Login />
  <Profile />

    </UserContextProvider>
  )
  /*
Wraps the Login and Profile components with the UserContextProvider.
Renders a heading (<h1>) with the text "React with Context API" followed by the Login and Profile components.
  */

export default App

/*
Reasoning:
Context Provider Usage:

Reasoning: Wrapping the Login and Profile components with the UserContextProvider ensures that they have access to the user context and can consume user-related data and functions.
Effect on Application: Facilitates communication between the Login and Profile components and the UserContextProvider, allowing them to interact with user-related state and logic stored in the context.
Rendering Components:

Reasoning: Rendering the Login and Profile components within the UserContextProvider ensures that they are rendered within the context of the user context, enabling them to access and modify user-related data.
Effect on Application: Provides a seamless user experience where the Login and Profile components can interact with user data without having to pass props manually, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
